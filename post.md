A new colleague was using something like this in interactive python during his first days to learn about history of a new project he was assigned to.

This caught my attention as it is really great way of getting additional perspective on the state of git project. It helps with seeing where the core issue of the project is being addressed, by showing which files are edited most, and contain the largest amount of collaborators. Based on this its easier to find out which parts of the code are more interesting, and likely to be touched in the future, so it might make sense to learn a bit more about them.

I was using [git-truck](https://github.com/git-truck/git-truck), which is very convenient tools. It is installed and executed by one simple command `npx -y git-truck`.

I especially appreciate the simplicity of these two libraries. How nicely they fit together and can be used in symbiosis in order to create neat renders.
